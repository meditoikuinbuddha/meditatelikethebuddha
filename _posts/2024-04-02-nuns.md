<center><i>"Just a year or two ago, the idea of a thriving Early Buddhist monastic community led by women, with women studying suttas, teaching the Dhamma, running the monastery, and following the full set of precepts prescribed in the Vinaya would have been unfathomable to me. 

Now it is very likely that I’ll be able to see it in person on my next journey to the UK!"</i></center>

<a href="https://anukampaproject.org/2024/02/28/a-dhamma-journey-from-laos-to-the-uk/">Check out this inspiring story of Casey</a>, a supporter of Anukampa Bhikkhuni Project in UK, who has travelled a long road to witness a community she always was looking for. 

Her story is a good example of why it is crucial for everyone to support the growing <i>Bhikkhunī Saṅgha</i>.

Anukampa Bhikkhuni Project, run by Ven.Canda, recently sealed the deal for a new property in England. If you want to support them, consider donating <a href="https://anukampaproject.org/donate/">here</a>.
