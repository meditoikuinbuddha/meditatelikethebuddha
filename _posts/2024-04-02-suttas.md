<h2>What actually are the teachings of the Buddha?</h2>
<img src="https://suttacentral.net/img/home-page/editions2.avif" alt="suttacentral">

The Buddha’s teachings on meditation, morality, the nature of the world, and the path to freedom are found in what we call <i>suttas</i>. 

These scriptures are our primary sources for the historical Buddha’s life and practice. They depict the Buddha and his students in lively conversation with a diverse range of people.

The suttas of the Pali Canon (<i>Tipiṭaka</i>), especially the four main <i>nikāyas</i>, are essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand the Buddha and his teaching. 

They have been preserved and passed down in the Pali language by the <i>Theravāda</i> tradition of Buddhism as the word of the Buddha.

These texts were originally passed down orally, by generations of monks and nuns who memorized them and recited them together. Around 30 BCE they were written down in the Āluvihāra in Sri Lanka, and subsequently were transmitted in manuscripts of palm leaves.

From the 19th century, the manuscripts were edited and published as modern editions in sets of books. In addition, the Pali text was translated into a number of modern languages, including Thai, Burmese, Sinhalese, and English.

<h2>The three baskets</h2>

The word <i>Tipiṭaka</i> means “Three Baskets”. The Basket of Discourses is traditionally listed as the second of the three. The four nikāyas make up the bulk of the Basket of Discourses. Here is how they are situated within the canon as a whole.

<b>Vinaya Piṭaka (Basket of Monastic Law)</b><br>
<b>Sutta Piṭaka (Basket of Discourses)</b><br>
- Dīgha Nikāya (Long Discourses)<br>
- Majjhima Nikāya (Middle Discourses)<br>
- Saṁyutta Nikāya (Linked Discourses)<br>
- Aṅguttara Nikāya (Numbered Discourses)<br>
- Khuddaka Nikāya (Minor Discourses)<br>
<b>Abhidhamma Piṭaka (Basket of Systematic Treatises)</b><br>

Similar collections are found in ancient Chinese translations, and substantial portions of them are also in Sanskrit and Tibetan. 

The diverse collections of scriptures arose among the Buddhist communities who spread across greater India in the centuries following the Buddha, especially under the Buddhist emperor, Ashoka. 

These missions are documented in the ancient chronicles of Sri Lanka as well as the Vinaya commentaries in Pali and Chinese, and have been partially corroborated by modern archaeology.

<a href="https://suttacentral.net">SuttaCentral</a> hosts almost all of these texts and provides comprehensive parallels showing the relations between them. 

A comparative understanding based on the full spectrum of these texts is essential for any study of early Buddhism. 

The Chinese Buddhist canon, in particular, contains a vast amount of translations of early texts, and in terms of quantity it outweighs the Pali texts by some margin.

For many reasons, though, the Pali texts will always retain a special place for those who wish to understand what the Buddha taught.

<b>- They are the only complete set of scriptures of an early school of Buddhism.</b><br>
<b>- They are by far the largest body of texts to survive in an early Indic dialect.</b><br>
<b>- They are accompanied by an extensive and detailed set of ancient commentaries (<i>aṭṭhakathā</i>)</b><br>.
<b>- They are, for the most part, linguistically clear, well-edited, and readily comprehensible.</b><br>

Moreover, the Pali texts are the core scriptures of a living tradition, the <i>Theravāda</i> school found in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, India, China, and Vietnam. 

To this day they are recited, taught, studied, and practiced daily, and are regarded in the traditions as being a reliable witness to the teachings of the Buddha himself.

Among the Pali texts, it is the four <i>nikāyas</i> that command the most attention. 

It is here that we find extensive and definitive explanations of Buddhist teachings, as well as the living personality of the Buddha and his immediate disciples.
